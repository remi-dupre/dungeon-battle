Dungeon Battle
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/remi-dupre/dungeon-battle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/remi-dupre/dungeon-battle)
==============

Compile
-------
The project must be compiled as C++ 14 code. It depends of `libsfml-dev` that is available in most distributions repositories.
You can use the Makefile to compile the project by executing `make release` at project's root.

Contribute
----------
A code reference can be found on [github pages](https://remi-dupre.github.io/dungeon-battle/index.html).
You can also generate the documentation by running `make doc`, this requires doxygen.

We defined a prefered coding style in the file [coding_style.md](https://github.com/remi-dupre/dungeon-battle/blob/master/coding_style.md).
